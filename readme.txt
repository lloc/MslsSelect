Transforms the output of the Multisite Language Switcher to an HTML select

== Description ==

Most people are likely to use some lines of PHP or the widget provided by the [Multisite Language Switcher](http://wordpress.org/plugins/multisite-language-switcher/) to integrate the links to the translations in their blogs.

If you look for an easy way to change the output of the **Multisite Language Switcher** as an HTML select with some JavaScript that forwards the visitor automatically after selecting an option then give **MslsSelect** a try.

== Installation ==

* Download the plugin and uncompress it with your preferred unzip programme
* Copy the entire directory in your plugin directory of your WordPress blog (/wp-content/plugins)
* Activate the plugin and see the magic ;)

== Changelog ==
